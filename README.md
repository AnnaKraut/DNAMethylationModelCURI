# methylation-modeling
At this time this code does not have a frontend: to run it you will need to open and run it with a code editor.

## Files
### gillespie-simplified
This is my first attempt at writing a gillespie algorithm in Python. It contains birth and death events for a single population.
### gillespie-simplified-oop
I rewrote my algorithm in Object-Oriented format, partly as an exercise and partly to make it easier to run large numbers of simulations. It contains birth and death events for a single population.
